"""tes/budget.py — Rolling-window spend tracking + honest self-trend projection.

Design: research/13_coach_alarm_honesty_design.md (reviewed and approved).

The projection is the user's OWN trend over the trailing window, linearly
extrapolated to the window's end, and ALWAYS labeled with its N (sessions,
days observed) and the non-forecast caveat. Never "you will spend $X" — the
message is always framed as "trending toward," never a promise.

**source_mtime, not scored_at (issue #12)**: filters on the session FILE's
own last-write time on disk -- when the real usage happened -- not on
`scored_at` (when `tes score`/`tes scan` happened to run). These coincide
under an immediate-scoring workflow but diverge under batch-scoring: every
session scored in one `tes scan` run gets the SAME `scored_at`, which would
cluster a week of real spend onto one instant or drop it outside the
window entirely. Same fix `tes/cost_period.py`'s `compute_period_cost`
already applies, for the identical reason -- see that module's own
docstring for the full argument. `source_mtime` is a `REAL` epoch float
column (unlike `scored_at`'s ISO-string column), so this module compares
`datetime.timestamp()`, not `.isoformat()`.
