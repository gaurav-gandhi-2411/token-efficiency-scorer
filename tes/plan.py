"""tes/plan.py — Plan-cost configuration and ROI computation.

XX1.1: "Is my subscription worth it at API-equivalent prices?" -- the ROI
side of `tes cost --roi`. Two deliberate design choices, both driven by
XX1.2's honesty requirements:

**A plan HISTORY, not a single static plan.** A user's plan can change
mid-window (upgraded from Pro to Max, added a second seat) -- a single
static `monthly_cost_usd` would either misprice the whole window at the
wrong rate or require the user to re-run the report per sub-window by
hand. `load_plan_config` returns an ordered list of `PlanPeriod` entries,
each with its own `effective_from` date; `prorated_plan_cost` walks the
window day by day, always pricing each day at whichever plan was actually
in effect that day, and correctly handles a plan change landing inside the
window.

**A partial-month window is prorated by day, not by calendar month.**
Matches this project's own established rolling-window convention
(`tes/cost_period.py`, `tes/budget.py`): `--week`/`--month` are rolling
N-day windows, not calendar-aligned, so plan cost must scale the same way
-- `monthly_cost_usd / 30` per day, summed over the window's actual day
count, never a flat monthly figure regardless of window length.
