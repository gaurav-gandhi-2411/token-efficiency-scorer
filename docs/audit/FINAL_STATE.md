# Final State Report — adk-tracegauge + token-efficiency-scorer

Session date: 2026-08-20. Orchestrator run covering AI1–AI4 of the release/audit queue.
All claims below are VERIFIED via git/PyPI/gh CLI evidence captured during this session,
independently re-checked by a blind verifier subagent that did not see the release
executor's own output. Nothing here is stated from memory.

---

## AI1 — Both releases

### 1.1 Pre-flight sync

- `token-efficiency-scorer` PR #34 (`chore/release-0.12.2`) merged to `master` @
  `4aaaba4c2e1393794770a682b09ff178921b3dba`. Local checkout fast-forwarded from `71fc04d`.
- `adk-tracegauge` PR #28 (`chore/release-0.5.1`) merged to `main` @
  `e06af2e487dfec1395fd6535f8a9bc5247e847da`. Local checkout fast-forwarded from `f76df6f`.
- Both repos confirmed clean (`git status --porcelain` empty) and `HEAD` matching the SHAs
  above at end of session.

### 1.2 — adk-tracegauge 0.5.1

**Pre-tag artifact check — VERIFIED.** `uv build` succeeded; clean venv installed the built
wheel (`C:\adkrel0501`, short path — the default scratch path hit Windows `WinError 206`
filename-too-long via `litellm`'s `vertex_ai_partner_models` subpackage, a real instance of
this project's own documented MAX_PATH trap). Both independent version reads returned
`0.5.1`:
- `import adk_tracegauge; adk_tracegauge.__version__` → `0.5.1`
- `importlib.metadata.version('adk-tracegauge')` → `0.5.1`

**Tag/push — one transient retry.** `git tag v0.5.1` on `e06af2e`; first `git push` failed
with a GitHub-side `500 Internal Server Error` (confirmed via `git ls-remote` returning
empty — nothing landed, no partial state). This was a transport-layer failure, not a release
gate failure (build, version, and tag content had all already passed). A single plain retry
of the identical, already-correct push succeeded: `[new tag] v0.5.1 -> v0.5.1`.

**CI — VERIFIED success.** Run `32391172284`: build, `twine check`, PyPI publish (Trusted
Publishing/OIDC), and `gh release create` all green, ~27s total.

**Independent blind verification (separate subagent, fresh venv, no access to the release
executor's claims):**

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| PyPI `info.version` | `0.5.1` — VERIFIED |
| PyPI README (`info.description`) contains exit-code-4 docs | VERIFIED — see verbatim snippet below |
| `v0.5.1` tag on GitHub → `e06af2e...` | VERIFIED |
| GitHub Release `v0.5.1` exists, published, not draft | VERIFIED (published `2026-08-20T16:18:05Z`) |
| Fresh PyPI install (`C:\adkver0501`, new venv) reports `0.5.1` | VERIFIED |

**Published-artifact verbatim (from PyPI's JSON API `info.description`, the actual rendered
README on the live PyPI project page):**

> `adk-tracegauge check` runs a percentile bootstrap on the difference in mean cost and exits
> with a **real, distinguishable exit code**: `0` pass, `1` regression, `3` insufficient data,
> `4` pass but underpowered (two-sample mode only — see "Known limitations" below; a real,
> non-zero exit code your CI should distinguish from a hard failure if it treats any non-zero
> exit as build-failing).

Extended discussion of exit code 4's runtime-detection mechanism and power analysis also
confirmed present in the "Known limitations" section of the published page.

### 1.3 / 1.4 — tracegauge 0.12.2

This release exists specifically to fix a real packaging gap surfaced by PR #31: `web/static/
brand/*.svg` and `web/static/fonts/*.woff2` were never declared in `[tool.setuptools.
package-data]`. A prior version installed from a real wheel (not the editable checkout used
to build the feature) would 404 on the dashboard's favicon and fall back to system fonts.
Both the pre-tag and post-publish checks specifically exercised the **installed wheel**, not
the checkout, per the standing instruction that testing against the checkout would not catch
a regression of this exact bug.

**Pre-tag artifact check — VERIFIED**, clean venv `C:\tgrel0122`:
- `tes.exe --version` → `tes 0.12.2`; `importlib.metadata.version('tracegauge')` → `0.12.2`.
- dist-info license files present: `licenses/LICENSE`, `licenses/LICENSE-APACHE`.
- On-disk site-packages brand/font files confirmed present (2 SVGs, 5 woff2s).
- `tes serve` started with `TES_DB_PATH` pointed at an isolated scratch DB; favicon and font
  URLs (read from `base.html`) both returned HTTP 200 with correct content-type.
- **Real `~/.tes/tes.db` confirmed never written** — mtime unchanged before/during/after
  every server run this session (`2026-08-17 18:54:27`, stable throughout). One cosmetic
  false alarm caught and correctly investigated in-flight: the `tes serve` startup banner
  prints the literal string `~/.tes/tes.db` regardless of `TES_DB_PATH`, which is a display
  bug in `tes/cli.py` (~line 505), not an actual write-path bug — the real write path was
  confirmed correct via `store.resolve_db_path` and the scratch DB's own file growth. Filed
  as a new minor finding below (not one of the three known open issues).

**Tag/push — clean, no retries needed.** `v0.12.2` tagged on `4aaaba4`, pushed successfully
first attempt.

**CI — VERIFIED success, log-confirmed (not just checkmark).** Run `32400917796`; log contains
the genuine upload confirmation `Successfully verified SCT...` and
`View at: https://pypi.org/project/tracegauge/0.12.2/`.

**GitHub Release — created manually** (this repo's `release.yml`, unlike adk-tracegauge's,
has no auto-create step): `gh release create v0.12.2 --generate-notes`, confirmed via
`gh release view v0.12.2`.

**Independent blind verification (separate subagent, fresh venv `C:\tgblind0122`, no access
to the release executor's claims):**

| Check | Result |
|---|---|
| PyPI `info.version` | `0.12.2` — VERIFIED |
| `v0.12.2` tag on GitHub → `4aaaba4...` | VERIFIED |
| GitHub Release `v0.12.2` exists, published, not draft | VERIFIED (`2026-08-20T18:02:47Z`) |
| Fresh PyPI install reports `0.12.2` (`tes.exe --version`) | VERIFIED |
| Brand SVGs + font woff2s present in fresh install's site-packages | VERIFIED (2 SVGs, 5 woff2s, all non-empty) |
| Real `~/.tes/tes.db` untouched during blind verifier's own `tes serve` run | VERIFIED — exact mtime match before/after |
| Favicon URL → HTTP 200, `image/svg+xml` | VERIFIED |
| Font URL → HTTP 200, `application/octet-stream` | VERIFIED |

**On the screenshot requirement (1.4):** no browser/screenshot automation tool is available
in this session (checked via tool search — nothing beyond `WebFetch`, which cannot render or
screenshot). `playwright`/`chromium` are not declared dependencies of this repo
(`pyproject.toml`/`uv.lock` grepped, no match) despite a changelog line from an earlier
session claiming a headless-Chromium visual check — that check is not reproducible in this
environment. In its place, the release executor performed a byte-level equivalent: it
byte-compared (`diff` + `md5sum`, identical hashes) the HTTP response body of the served
favicon and a font file against the corresponding on-disk file inside the installed venv's
`site-packages`, proving the running server was genuinely serving the installed package's own
asset bytes, not a fallback or a stale copy. This is offered as the verified substitute, not
a claimed equivalent to a visual screenshot — flagged explicitly rather than silently assumed
equivalent.

### 1.5 — GitHub Releases

- adk-tracegauge: auto-created by `release.yml`'s `gh release create` step. VERIFIED live.
- tracegauge: manually created (`gh release create v0.12.2 --generate-notes`) since this
  repo's workflow has no auto-create step. VERIFIED live.

---

## AI2 — Corpus consent, verified from the published artifact

Installed `tracegauge==0.12.2` fresh from PyPI (blind verifier's own venv, `C:\tgblind0122`,
independent of the release executor's earlier install). Ran both commands directly.

**`tes corpus contribute` — verbatim output:**

```
[NOT AVAILABLE] No community corpus is currently operated — `tes corpus contribute` has
nowhere to send data yet. The code path is built and tested (see PRIVACY.md); it activates
once a corpus is provisioned. Nothing is sent by this command today.
```

**`tes corpus withdraw` — verbatim output:**

```
[NOT AVAILABLE] No community corpus is currently operated — there is nothing to withdraw
from yet. This command will work once a corpus is provisioned; see PRIVACY.md.
```

Both commands exited immediately with the `[NOT AVAILABLE]` message and asked **no**
interactive question — confirms the fix: the availability check now runs before any consent
prompt, closing the gap where a user answering "y" to "Send to the community corpus?"
believed data was transmitted when it never could be.

**`tes corpus --help` — verbatim matching text:**

```
NOT YET ACTIVE: no public corpus is currently operated, so these subcommands print
[NOT AVAILABLE] and do nothing until one is provisioned — see PRIVACY.md.
```

Per-subcommand help also confirmed:

```
contribute   Preview + consent + send content-free session aggregates to the community
             corpus. NOT YET ACTIVE — no corpus is operated.
withdraw     Delete every row tied to your contributor_id from the community corpus.
             NOT YET ACTIVE — no corpus is operated.
```

AI2 fully VERIFIED — 2.2 and 2.3 both pass.

---

## AI3 — Task list integrity

**3.1/3.2 — Reconciled against actual state, not memory.** Every release-related item was
checked against PyPI/git directly this session rather than trusted from any prior list:

- tracegauge 0.12.0, 0.12.1 were, in fact, already live on PyPI before this session started
  (confirmed via tag history `v0.12.0`, `v0.12.1` present and PyPI JSON API's version history
  — not re-verified in depth this session since they were not in scope, but their tags exist
  and 0.12.2 published cleanly on top of them with no gaps).
- adk-tracegauge 0.5.0 was live; 0.5.1 was the only pending item, now shipped.
- No stray tags, no tag/PyPI-version mismatches found in either repo.

**3.3 — Why completions weren't propagating: found a real, distinct root cause, not the one
implied by the prompt.** The specific claim "Q5 (tracegauge 0.12.1) shown as open after
being tagged/published/verified" does not correspond to any persisted artifact in this repo
— grepped `PLAN.md`, `CURRENT_STATE.md`, `NEXT_PHASE.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, and all of
`docs/audit/*.md` for the literal string `Q5`: zero matches anywhere. "Q5" was very likely an
ephemeral in-session task list (e.g. a `TodoWrite`-style list) from a single prior CC session,
which by design does not persist across sessions — so it cannot be inspected now, and its
staleness (if real) left no durable trace to audit.

**A separate, independently-verified propagation gap was found and is more actionable:**
this project's own auto-memory file, `project_context.md` (under
`C:\Users\gaura\.claude\projects\...\memory\`), stops at the **0.10.0** release
(2026-07-04) and was never updated through 0.11.0, 0.11.1, 0.12.0, 0.12.1, or 0.12.2 —
five shipped releases with zero corresponding memory update, despite `CHANGELOG.md`
documenting all five. `MEMORY.md`'s index line for this file still reads *"0.10.0 LIVE on
PyPI: live monitor+alarm+budget shipped, coach HELD"* as of this session's start — actively
misleading for any future session that trusts it without re-verifying against PyPI, exactly
the failure mode CLAUDE.md rule 118a's tracegauge PR #16 incident already names. This memory
file has been corrected as part of this session's work (see below) — the durable version of
the "stale task list" problem is now fixed; the ephemeral-list version cannot be, by
construction, and the fix for that class of gap is procedural (checkpoint into PLAN.md more
consistently, per CLAUDE.md rule 118), not something further auditing here will surface.

## AI4 — Final state

### 4.1 — Published versions, confirmed live and installable

| Package | Version | PyPI | Fresh-venv install confirmed |
|---|---|---|---|
| `adk-tracegauge` | 0.5.1 | https://pypi.org/project/adk-tracegauge/0.5.1/ | VERIFIED (`C:\adkver0501`) |
| `tracegauge` | 0.12.2 | https://pypi.org/project/tracegauge/0.12.2/ | VERIFIED (`C:\tgver0122`, `C:\tgblind0122`) |

### 4.2 — Repo state

Both `main`/`master` clean, branch-protected (required status checks, `enforce_admins: true`,
required PR reviews), and in sync with the tagged release commits. Zero open PRs in either
repo as of this session's end.

**Open issues:**

adk-tracegauge: none open.

token-efficiency-scorer:
- [#35](https://github.com/gaurav-gandhi-2411/token-efficiency-scorer/issues/35) — `CorpusNotConfigured` exception exported but never raised (dead code).
- [#36](https://github.com/gaurav-gandhi-2411/token-efficiency-scorer/issues/36) — `backfill_turn_counts()` has zero callers (dead code, self-documented, confirmed still true).
- [#37](https://github.com/gaurav-gandhi-2411/token-efficiency-scorer/issues/37) — two dead `sqlite3` imports in near-identical `cli.py` try blocks.

**New minor finding this session (not yet filed as an issue):** `tes/cli.py`'s `serve`
startup banner (~line 505) prints the literal string `~/.tes/tes.db` for the "Database:"
line regardless of whether `TES_DB_PATH` is set — cosmetic only (the actual resolved write
path, via `tes/store.py`'s `resolve_db_path`, is correct), but misleading output that cost
real verification time this session (required tracing actual file mtimes to rule out a real
violation of the never-write-to-real-`~/.tes/` rule). Worth a one-line fix in a future patch.

### 4.3 — External PRs against Google repos

Two of the six have changed status since this queue was written; both re-verified via `gh pr
view` including comments, not assumed from title alone.

| Repo | PR | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|---|
| google/adk-docs | [#2128](https://github.com/google/adk-docs/pull/2128) | **CLOSED, declined** | Maintainer (`joefernandez`) closed with explicit feedback: *"We would like to see this integration grow more adoption and maturity before we list it as an ADK integration."* Not a bug, not abandoned — a deliberate pass on inclusion in the docs catalog. |
| google/adk-python | [#6739](https://github.com/google/adk-python/pull/6739) | OPEN | `fix(evaluation): honor each metric's own eval_status in AgentEvaluator.evaluate()` — active review discussion. |
| google/adk-python | [#6740](https://github.com/google/adk-python/pull/6740) | OPEN | `fix(cli): adk eval process exit code now reflects PASSED/FAILED`. |
| google/adk-python | [#6710](https://github.com/google/adk-python/pull/6710) | OPEN | `fix(evaluation): record NOT_EVALUATED instead of dropping invocations with zero auto-rater samples` — reviewer comment from a second-party auditor ("mycroft") present, unresolved. |
| google/adk-python | [#6682](https://github.com/google/adk-python/pull/6682) | OPEN | `fix(evaluation): NOT_EVALUATED metric no longer masked by a passing one`. |
| google/adk-python | [#6681](https://github.com/google/adk-python/pull/6681) | **MERGED** (via Copybara) | GitHub shows `state: CLOSED`, `mergedAt: null` because Google imports external PRs internally via Copybara rather than a native GitHub merge — but the change is genuinely live: verified commit `023f45c3e5846c3e72525b53f16ef018b5ecdaa6` exists on `google/adk-python`'s `main`, commit message reads `Merge https://github.com/google/adk-python/pull/6681`, carries a `PiperOrigin-RevId`. Confirmed via `gh api repos/google/adk-python/commits/023f45c`. |

### 4.4 — What each package does, measures, and does not claim

**adk-tracegauge** is a CI cost-regression gate for Google ADK agent evaluations: it runs a
two-sample percentile-bootstrap test comparing an agent's per-eval-case token cost between a
baseline and a candidate run, and exits with a distinguishable code (`0` pass, `1`
regression, `3` insufficient data, `4` pass-but-underpowered) so a CI pipeline can gate merges
on cost regressions the same way it gates on test failures. It measures cost only — token
counts converted to USD via a maintained pricing table — not output quality, correctness, or
task success; those remain the job of ADK's own `AgentEvaluator`. It explicitly does not
claim its bootstrap test has validated statistical power for every possible eval-case count
(exit code 4 exists precisely to flag when a "pass" verdict is underpowered rather than
silently reporting a false confidence), and it does not claim compatibility with
`AgentEvaluator`'s `App`/plugin-based custom-metric path — that integration route was found,
live-verified, and documented not to work against `google-adk==2.6.3` (see the adk-docs #2128
history above), with a hand-rolled `Runner` harness documented as the actually-working
integration path today.

**tracegauge** (import name `tes`) is a three-axis efficiency scorer for Claude Code coding
sessions: token economy (cost/waste relative to a self-baseline), trajectory quality (via an
optional LLM judge), and deterministic waste detection (context-resend, redundant reads,
repeated-failed-retries, and similar patterns detected without any LLM call). It is local-only
by default — no server, no telemetry, nothing transmitted unless the user explicitly opts in
per-feature (the API judge, or the local contribution export). It explicitly does not claim
predictive power ("I don't predict" is a hardcoded chat-layer boundary for future-looking
questions), does not claim validated accuracy against human judgment for the trajectory-
quality axis outside its existing calibration work, and does not operate a community corpus
today — that capability is fully built and tested but deliberately dormant (see 4.5).

### 4.5 — Deliberately not built, with revisit triggers

- **Community-corpus baseline** (`tes corpus contribute`/`withdraw`, cross-developer
  percentile baselines): code, RLS policy, content-free send-time guard, and tests are all
  complete (`docs/audit` and `CURRENT_STATE.md`'s 0.9.0 section). Not activated because zero
  contributors exist and provisioning live transmission infrastructure before anyone can use
  it is premature. **Revisit trigger:** the moment a real user asks for cross-developer
  baselines, or the maintainer decides contributor acquisition is worth pursuing —
  activation is a documented ~20-minute checklist (`CURRENT_STATE.md` lines 116–136), not a
  rebuild.
- **OG-preview automation** (uploading a social-preview image to GitHub's repo settings):
  `assets/brand/og-preview.svg` (1200×630) exists but only as SVG — GitHub's social-preview
  upload slot requires a raster PNG/JPG, and no GitHub API exists for this upload (it's a
  Settings-UI-only action). **Revisit trigger:** none needed technically — this is purely a
  manual step blocked on API absence, not a design decision; route to GG (below).
- **Q6 — dashboard trajectory timeline + sub-agent spawn trees:** design-only
  (`docs/design/DASHBOARD_TRAJECTORY_TIMELINE.md`), explicitly routed for review before any
  implementation starts, per the doc's own header. **Revisit trigger:** design sign-off from
  GG.
- **Cost-quality Pareto frontier / changepoint detection on cost trends:** feasible (per
  `docs/audit/COMPETITIVE_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`'s Phase 8 "rigor + demand" test), but killed
  alongside multi-source adapter support (§2.4) for the identical reason: real feasibility
  without validated demand is architecture for its own sake. **Revisit trigger:** an
  unprompted external user request for either, per the same test used to kill "Option C" and
  HH2/HH3.1-2.
- **Option C — engine consolidation:** killed under Phase 8's demand test in an earlier
  phase, cited again in the Phase-9-era competitive-gap analysis as the reference case for
  "feasible, zero demand." **Revisit trigger:** same as above — a validated demand signal, not
  a feasibility argument.

---

## ROUTE TO GG

**PRs awaiting merge:** none. Zero open PRs in either repo as of this session's end.

**Venvs/paths the sandbox would not let this session delete** (all outside the repos, all
inert — no running processes, none referenced by either repo, safe to delete at your
convenience):
- `C:\adkrel0501`, `C:\adkver0501` (adk-tracegauge pre-tag/post-publish verification venvs)
- `C:\tgrel0122`, `C:\tgrel0122-scratch`, `C:\tgver0122`, `C:\tgver0122-scratch`,
  `C:\tgblind0122`, `C:\tgblind0122-scratch` (tracegauge pre-tag/post-publish/blind-verify
  venvs and their isolated scratch DB directories)

**Paid Gemini validation run (~$0.0065)** — unchanged from the prior session's report
(`adk-tracegauge/docs/audit/AUTONOMOUS_RUN.md`, "ROUTE TO GG" section, R1), restated here
since it remains un-run and this queue asked it be carried forward: confirms whether
Ollama's local 7B-model cost-variance measurement is representative of a real hosted model.
Steps: swap `LiteLlm(model="ollama_chat/qwen2.5:7b")` for `model="gemini-2.5-flash-lite"` in
the existing 36-case evalset (no synthetic price table needed — real published rate).
Estimated cost ≈$0.0065 total (mean 107.8 input + 423.2 output tokens × 36 cases), a few
cents even with a 3–5x safety margin. Requires a real `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, which this
environment does not have. Full detail in `docs/audit/AD2_REAL_CV_MEASUREMENT.md` §2.3.

**OG-preview PNG upload to GitHub's social-preview slot:** `assets/brand/og-preview.svg`
(1200×630) exists and is ready; needs conversion to PNG/JPG and manual upload via each
repo's Settings → Social Preview — no GitHub API exists for this action.

## Memory correction made this session

`project_context.md` (auto-memory) updated to reflect 0.11.0 through 0.12.2 having shipped —
it previously stopped at 0.10.0, a five-release gap with no corresponding memory entry. See
AI3 above for the full finding.
